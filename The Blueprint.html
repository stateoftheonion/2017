to be the ladies man first, IT guy second</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
The truth is IT gets me all tense, the habit built over the years is
of all or nothing perfections, no inbetween plans and learning to cut
it and go home for the day. With that habit what’s happend to me is
when it comes to work I cannot chill in the inbetweens and lately the
moment I think responsibility in terms of keeping the mind focused
etc in the form of day to day IT, I cringe, it makes me puke now that
I’m aware of the more important things in life. The skill to learn
here is detachment, detaching from the day to day cringe, also the
new default to set is I’m a social, a ladies man, a fun, playful
and humourous guy and when it comes down to doing work or getting
down to business I can focus for that amount of time and then return
to my default. I feel the most relaxed with myself when I think
social, ladies man, lots of friends. Also at the same time a lone
focused wolf who can go ahead and work and earn money creatively also
and lead others to earn well by founding something special, fun,
creative and social, which could also be in IT itself. This ladies
man mindset requires 100% commitment however as I can’t be both and
half-ass it. The truth is the IT part is part of me and I cannot wish
it not, I can start thinking it differently from now on, all this
while I was looking to be the best coder and reach Google heights
when I knew that was never realistically possible as I did not work
in the direction for it and mostly reasons for wanting to reach there
was ego based, to post some “look at me now” shit on FB. In
reality, right now at a small agency, I have a team to manage, who do
the work for me, I can learn how to deal with people, manage them and
get work done. After all I’m there todo work and get shit done. Not
focusing on IT as a life default would need someone guiding me too or
I can experiement with spotting the gaps and see if that works or
explore productvity techniques for real. The questions to always ask
is “Is my life a party? Can I invite people into this party? Can I
pay to host my party?”</p>

<b>Triggers</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
I get triggered when someone does not agree with my beliefs or when I
feel attacked and now recently because I am more open I get triggered
when someone is not open, there are several ways to deal with these
situations, the least effective being going to a fight or flight
response caused by blood rushing to the locomotive organs when
triggered and letting the “emotions” take over blocking my mind
from rational though. The effective way is to first be aware of
triggers and experience the emotion and then let blood flow back to
the brain by First and foremost, Recalling the Goal of the
conversation or recalling what I want out of this relationship with
the person triggering me. Second, understanding the other persons
reason why they differ or have oposing views or doing something that
would piss me off, its tracing the other persons path to action,
Mostly I find people themselves are triggered hence they do what they
do. Doing these two things flows blood back to the brain and then
lets me make a rational descison and respond appropriately. This is
healhty debate or conversation in the moment, but ever so often I
will find someone knowingly or unknowigly wanting to trigger me for
the heck of it or for the joy of it, perceived power or assumed will
over me lets them do so, in these cases I’ve found humor is the
best medicine. In times when people express oposing views and beliefs
the best is to just listen and agree to disagree as you cannot really
convince someone to look at your argument or sway someone over unless
through power or force. While rushing blood back throght thinking or
humor are surface in the moment best goto solutions, the depth of it
is what is the reason for the trigger, has to be braought to the
surface and dealth with for long term “peace”. Triggers are a
great way of getting rid of the shit that blocks me, look to be
triggered and anticiapte it, Life is irritable.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Social
Alliances</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">One
major issue is not having bros or reliable male friends to count
upon, the issue lies in not looking towards new places to get social
alliance needs met when required out of ego or fear of being
rejected. It’s also no ones fault that I do not see life like my
past bros, everyone has their own path in time and paths change after
a few months. Forgiveness is key as they do not know what they do.
It’s nothing personal. It’s important to respect and stay away
from those topics of politics, spirituality, gender equality etc if
people are biased and closed off, It’s ok, look to be curious about
where the person is coming from when triggered. Another issue is
about fear of being fucked over for the sake of ego, revenge, a girl
or just plain stupidity. Social alliances are important, focus on
what I’m good at, the one on one interactions, do it at scale as
with my default of ladies man also includes social man. Key is being
open to forming and merging groups regardless of control or outcome.
A quality of a social leader is making plans and assuming people will
respond and not being affected by outcome. Secondly being open to let
older bros back in, at each point of life different bros will be with
me, have to accept this and not let a broship drag for too long or it
can crumble with opposinng beliefs in the present and not have a good
future which could have been. Hanging on for too long for pillar
support is not actually healthy, while hanging on socially is fine,
if new pillars based on new beliefs are required I have to go out and
get those. No man can survive alone.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>Women
and Dating</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Girls
who attract sport fucking for the notches and claims are not worth
it, first notches dont teach you much besides counting and bragging
and these women themselves can sniff out the fact that I’m there
for sex only and it takes a lot of effort to put in a “I also care”
front. Girls who have a known count are not worth it either, the
reason they sleep with everyone is low self esteem from a young age,
not their fault, but I’m not there for therapy hour, <b>I’m there
to get beautiful girls</b><b>.</b> Girls who do not put out after
considerable effort can be forgotten, there are other Girls to fuck
out there. Girls worth approaching and persuing are who I think are
my 10 for whatever reason, its a feeling that draws me towards them,
reminds me that I am awesome and I go ahead and get them Man to
Woman. Ofcouse girls who are not my 10 can be approached for
practicing new skills, applying effort beyond that is not efficient.
Finally, What love is, is truly unknown to me. I know what Love is
not. Neediness is not Love, Possession is not love, Control is not
love, Falling for her because she’s innocently playing hard to get
is not Love, Falling for her because shes not interested or ignoring
is not Love, Not wanting to have sex so that I respect her and take
it slow is not Love. All these are misinformation and disney love.
Women are sexual and love sex. Love starts with the physical. I’m
closer to all the girls I’ve slept with no matter how shallow the
experience was at first compared to the girls who I’ve kept as just
friends or who have kept me as just friends. Finally, going for my 10
is what she wants also, I’m not taking anything from her contrary
to what I am made to believe thru religion and media, she wants it
too because my 10 is her 10. <b>She wants to be approached.</b></p>

has a life</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">Often
when I’m getting a girl out, it can turn needy because of the ego
and how important we perceive ourselves to be, the mindset to adopt
here is “I’m in the middle of fucking 10 models right now and I
hit you up to see what’s up with you”. Most girls will not budge
when being asked out, and that’s ok and it’s a good thing. They
have a life, being persistent along with the above mindset will
convert numbers to the max. In time practicing plate theory and mltrs
help. It’s like I’m seeing multiple girls but keeping the flow of
leads going. And I’m not worried about quality as initially I’ve
already judged them my 10s.</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
Routine makes life boring and pass by soon, planned routine is key to
a good life, running everything I do through efficiency theory, the
second key is to also spot the difference between a forced
routine(passive, rotines that make me wait for friday, xmas, easter
etc) and a routine out of power and wanting todo the things I’m
doing. While working 8 hours a day focus should be on work, while
sarging focus shoud be on sarging, while working on domains or a side
project, focus should be on what I set out todo creatively here.
Focus with an inderlining default of chill, inspiration and life is a
party. <b>Take things the way they come but direct the attention
towards what needs to be done </b><b>when doing it.</b></p>

Goals</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
Most Goals are ego driven, not authentic, I wanted to be a
millionaire so that I can be free and show an awesome life on
Instagram, but I never worked towards it. I still can be a
millionaire if I put my mind to it, but the reasons are to attain
personal freedom from the matrix, no one needs to know I have the
money. The idea behind all my oneites was to look stable and show
people that I have a “good” girl, in truth I did not succeed as
its a whole different ball game as I know now and in truth those
girls were not truly “good girls” as I know now, in real truth
they arent good or bad, they are just women. On the other end the
need to sleep with anyone who was available is crazy, the counting
game for brags and validation. <b>Today I look for the awesome
experience she and I will have within our combined worlds</b>.
Secondly, The chase for being a good coder and being a good
professional is again ego, so that someone pats me on the back for
being a good responsible value giving boy in society, earn the
heigest CTC possible and declare to the world at every promotion that
Ive made it, but it never feels like Ive made it, the Goal is not
authentic. What is authentic goal? I would say doing something  that
lets me 1. Build a life itself, a party to experience life and 2.
Build social alliances in different levels of healthyness, <b>Authentic
goals is not a struggle or to prove something. it’s acting from a
place of wholeness and looking at the world as a fun and welcoming
place todo the things I’m meant todo.</b></p>

It’s easy to get into self help and pop psycology in a egotistical
way and be all in my head and get onto a pedestale. What’s tougher
is to be intellectually and socially valuable to the world. Most
people are either and hence never reach real potential. I see myself
reaching a balance, the intelectual in me is taking a back seat to
give the socialite in me a chance, this might stall my career for a
while, but I trust that in balance I can grow from that place, that
balance is a default to self-love, and I can only grow from there
with power. Being present and aware of people around, smiling,
greeting no matter how superficial is key to building superficial
comfort with people, this is gateway to actual comfort, also always
go in with a point heigher energy than the crowd, decide to be
heigher energy every morning.</p>

<b>The penulimate shift and the penultimate purpose of life</b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%">
As men what we do in life is for one reason, sex, now this part of us
is frawned upon, why we are like this is because its our innate
nature to spread our seed far and wide. In modern society our natural
urge is shamed at the core, where we are teased for liking a girl and
then mocked if the girl does not give in, when we get the girl her
character is questioned or our manhood is questioned. The Drive we
have to please women and plant our seed in them has lead to
invention, creation, culture, society and basic modern world. Through
all the times the penultimate purpose has been lost and the modern
man uses Drive for goals, authentic and inauthentic, Goals not
related to getting women at all, dick logic if you will. The bottom
line is we are hear to get beautiful women. The way todo it is
already coded in our DNA, its at my disposal to use, a map if you
will, ofcouse modern society has changed the rules a bit and being
cognizant of this is required at the same time I need to reach a
point where I’m indifferent and I dont care who thinks I’m cool
for being with a girl or who thinks I’m a loser for trying.</p>

I believe my 3 selves in alignment want me to spread my seed far and
wide, I see stories of great casanovas and PUAs and I get insipred to
repeat their feats. I see love for women and replication in me, sure
people who know me will say, “ya you and love for women, you’re a
user”. I know my own path, it started with love for women, till I
used a wrong map of seduction and things got bitter over the years. I
have the right map now to direct myself towards a structured natural
path, its not about getting laid, lucky or finding the one. Its about
rediscovering my curiosity and love for women. I see a problem with
my Drive lately and I can trace it back to masturbation, its weird on
one end religion says its bad, on another end medicine says its
healthy, as teenage boy its bound to become a cumpulsion, and then
its hard to grow out of, add to the guild and shaming behind it and
we are left to hate our selves for just being male. I follow NoFap in
away that everytime I think of masturbation related to someone I know
or saw, I think to myself let’s preserve this energy and let’s
make the fantasy real, I never remember this in field, but I know in
time my ku will let me act through my intentions and my drive will be
back naturally. Confidence will radiate.</p>

When I’m out approaching I can feel my mind is not fully there to

1. I feel that what I’m doing is taboo, and if people found out I

finally got an explanation for this, There is social conditioning
that says I should do this and that or get shamed, sometimes fear is
used as a tactic also, then there is the reptilian brain that is only
worried about immediate survival, hence the cravings and wanting to
just nap because the home is the safest place to be in, then there is
the ego that has superficial and inauthentic goals that lead to bad
stress and diseases. Only when I  stamp this all away I see glimpses
