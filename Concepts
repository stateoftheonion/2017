- No matter how good a guy you are, Girls will detrust you coz of rape culture if you're not within her social circle, hence superficial comfort
- When a girl I tried to game isnt replaying and you meet her, challenge her about not replyign and being all busy with stupid stuff
- Absurdity is key to having a good time, use sparingly but
- Accues her of being a player or seducing you
- Women like eye contact never forget that, its not awkward, it never awkward, its connecting feel it
- of course people are gonna see me approach, also they dont care, also I dont care of the think Im some looser for trying
- Observe people, they are more worried about what you think of them, never give power away
- Cool guys never run
