1. A shift from comfortability seeking to day to day adventure in Nature, Business, and Women
My Default State - Passion for life and its scars. Living through excitement, humor, anticipation(positive visualization) and playfulness and going for what I want with pure Masculine Drive Being Focused - Working in Clock Time, ie. deciding for the next X hours I am doing this and being focused on it, also when unmotivated committing to just 10 mins of doing and achieving Flow for the X hours. After X hours detaching from the task and returning to My Default State. Producer Mindset - Looking to start trends, becoming a producer and profiting off of the trend that I produce. The profiting is secondary the starting something is Primary. Results Mindset - If I check for results on a daily basis I can give up easily, usually, things have to be given time, I've found the minimum required time for practicing anything new is 90-days

2. Indifference - The ability to let which does not matter truly slide
There are no reframes. Reframes like "other people are more worried about what you think of them", "always polarize", "cool guys never run" - all these make me focus on the external while the internal want is an afterthought. Indifference is going for what I want and not caring about what's external - people, situations or outcomes. It's also a way of saying "yeah, I've tried a lot, failed a lot, but I have more because the more I try the more opportunities I get, the more scars I get, I'm enlightened coz of them".

3. Look up and face the uncomfortable

4. The Blind Spot
I will get laid because women are friendly and sexual. And I know that its GAME NOT appearance(money, looks or status) is what gets girls and I am the shit. 

5. Tribes and Gangs
I will have a tribe because good men are mostly beta and are looking for a strong masculine leader. Other masculine leaders are looking to collaborate with me. (This mindset helps me a lot in business and working with people on a daily basis)

6. Being Curious

7. Do not take yourself too seriously
Imagine a world where people do not read, they do not know about fight or flight responses and go by living life based on how they "feel". In truth much of the stress people give you is based on their fight or flight(impulsive and aggressive) responses. The best way to take nothing personally is understand why people do what they do, put yourself in their shoes as they say. Why? As a seducer of life, Am I in the business of defending my fragile ego or am I in the business of achieving what I want for my life? It's natural to feel stress(anger n anxiety) when someone else around is dumping stress onto me. But as a modern Man I need to 1. Figure out why someone is doing what they are doing, figuring out the reason for their fight or flight 2. Remembering what I want from this situation. 3. Responding appropriately to the situation.

8. Humor is the best policy
Most people who dish out stress are actually seeking attention and comfort, its ok to comfort these people, lend them support. There are some who give out healthy stress as a means to an end. for eg. A boss stresses you out(often in a calm way) when a deadline in approaching so that you finish the project on time, he's not stressing you out coz he wants to be a dick, he's stressing you out because of a deadline. However, ever so often you come across this passive aggressive guy who on the surface is all "yay" but he hits you with a vocal jab whenever he can, it's like he's just angry at the world. The first way to deal with this is indifference, let it slide and ignore him. In today's entitled world, people keep going hence, the second way is Humor.
