The best community programs out there are Deep Inner Game, Mystery Method and Blueprint Decoded, a little old school but they set the foundation.

Deep Inner Game is further understood by reading MindOs it's a perfect pop psycology framework for understanding me and others, You put something like 48 laws of power over that and you can move from unhealthy narsaccism to healthy machavillinaism, of course The healthy machavillian balance is to have people I care about truly, never screwing them over at the same time not basing my life descisions on what they say or want. Machavillinaism is considered immoral to our collective social rightous society but is not illegal. World has become a place where shame is used as a tool to restrict people. Those shame tactics wont work on me. Call people out for doing it, then expose their real insecurities and flaws regarding why they are shaming you. At this point general public opionin wont be on my side, but atleast deep down the shamer becomes the shamed within.

Mystery Method is a perfect framework for pickup, perfect for a logic scientist who can remember 7 hours of game material and when to use what, for the rest of us watered down approach is way better, or small chunking is the best way to learn anything.
Other Advancements to mystery method include
- Swinggcats prize mindset of standard qualification - the flip that most guys need, make her jump through my hoop first explained well
- Sinns Qualification vehicle of small, medium and large qualifier and his ohh shit buttons
- RJ's I want girls, I'm here to get girls, I'm here to find out the truth about her, me and the situation, I'm shameless(Read JV) + the 4EG balance
- Most NSG guys - Pickup is suppose to be fun and touch and go, there is no real smooth process, just the reality that everyone makes mistakes to get perfect one day
- NSG's - Build superficial comfort first(Nice Guy Game) then break rapport
- Roosh and Rollo - Game in Reality

The Blueprint is interesting, because it gets you all motivated in 20 hours, I did my first approaches during the days of watching this. But lot of the tools and techniques coming from Tyler are applicable to himself, his life situation. But in the intro he says I wrote this for myself and now you have it. I feel it could work for someone in early 20s if this is the only program they ever go for and they have social connects to get them in meat markets immediately and consistently.

::MY GOALS:: 
1. Be a producer and generate passive income streams
2. Date a lot of hot women
3. Become the definition of "sexy older guy"
Everything I do is done through these 3 goals in mind. "It's always on" and the universe is actively working in my favour to help me achieve this lifestyle and life situauion. I take descions and make it my own responsibility to imporve my quality of life.

Default State
What do women seek for in a man they want to sleep with? What do men seek for in their leader? - One Word : Character
Humor and playfullness along with Drive showcases character. Sure, there will be stresses along the way, but people want to follow and believe in someone who can be cheerful and positive inspite of the stresses of life. This does not mean they ignore the stress, they acknowledge, take a min or two to feel bad, then relax and then get inspired naturally on what todo next.

No Completion
There is no "Ive made it in life". Everything I do should be for me, the moment I feel once I do this I can rest or once I do this (but have no plan) then I can do the next thing, it means I'm doing it to show someone, its ego. There is no completion of anything in life, just life itself. Even my goals are based on life itself everything in between are just signposts along the road indicating growth or right direction.

Life is ultimately a balance of going for things and flowing. Be Like Water. "Water always flows in a direction"

Good Habits are built with good momentum. Not taking descions everyday leads to passivity which is the worst habit

Money and stress
When making money, you either can get paid a nominal average everyone amount by taking a less stress job, a job where you can just get by, the stress does eventually come from the boredom or realiation that I'm not doing so well or not doing what I want todo in life, OR you can make more money being a producer or work for someone who is a producer making you a right hand man and is paying you better for taking on their stress. Work is stressful, there is no high paying easy job.

Defending the ego better
In todays world we have no real physical dangers, our survival instinct is gone from protecting our physical to protecting our egos, hence when we feel fight or flight we tend to act in impulsive or agressive ways. Once aware of this feeling spectrum its easier to take nothing personally and practice keeping a poker face. Then 1. Remebering what I want from the situation, decide to act through my goals 2. Tracing the other peoples path to action(Curiosity), then reacting appropriately. The mindless impulse or agression in the long run hurts us, a better way to protect the ego is to always think about whats in front again. What seperates winners from losers is how they react to a twist of faith. fight of flight is esentially stress, how we react to stress determines our fate.

AMOGging
Most people pour stress into other because they cannot handle life, they need support, lend that support. Other do it as a means to an end. eg. A boss stresses you out to finnish a project because he wants the project finished not because he wants to stress you out. But ever so often you come across that passivly angry person who just wants to piss you off for the heck of it. I used to be such a person because there was so much anger inside of me to give out. The best way to combat the old me and many people like this is humor. Absurdity and Exagerration. Secondly blatantly ignoring them with a "Ya cool man" and backturn

Being effective at doing work
Most people are day dreamers, not taking jobs seriously thinking by doing so they are hurting their boss or who ever, in truth they hurt themselves as they are building the habit of passivity by being passive during 1/3rd of the day. Some take it too seriously and work their asses off in pvertime. I know Ive been both these people. The best way to look at a job is its 8 hours and then detach from it, Working in Clock Time during the day, making atask list where we assign buckets of 1,2,4 hours of work and commiting to 10 mins of doing during the start of each bucket. Of course can do overtime if the situation demands, but do it in clock time and commitment. When wanting to be passive take a break and come back with better commitment.

The modern "aloof" player expecting women to come to him is a lie, never listen to uncles who tell you to be cool in the corner. lol

Money is freedom paper, CTC has no real value. The older you get the lesser you can creatively work. Make money when you're young

Break the walls down
People have their own ideas, beliefs and emotions, its good to be open towards them with Curiosity or collaborate with them in imagination with doors but taking in and making a final descison is always onus on me, no one else. Be calm always and listen. When a descion is left up in the air to make always lead to make that descion. Also when a descion is left up in the air, its a sign that you have to make it. Destroy the social ladder and be open to eveyrone, Its a mark of an intelligent man to entertain a thought before expecting it.

A leader does not dictate, A leader does not make desciosn to favour himslef, a leader is fair and makes descions for the group to survive and thrive.

Goals
Goals are outside the boundary, The space between me and the goal is where skills lie, skills are built using intellect to gain education and experience.
Just knowing the outcome and not being self invested in a goal is key to living life. Be complete within and walk through the world. More you go for, the more opportunites you get. Anyone who tells you otherwise or terms things as boring or hard or not required are lazy, putting you down or not letting you succed co of their own mediorcity.

When opening say "excuse me" because people never hear the first thing on an interrupt. People are usually in their own heads

When escalating start with the hands

Always come in higher energy than the set, one notch above, smile, look good, be confident, offer value

Eye contact is key to anything. Balance eye contact with a smile
